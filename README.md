# Yoimanga- a manga recommender (^_^)
YOu can type any number from 1 to 365, to get manga recommendations to keep you busy for next 1 year. I have given the site link above if you willing to try that, but main motto of this was to make a chrome extension out of this.
But screw you GOOGLE, for $5 plan of google to publish it in chrome made a broke student like me die of cringe.
Thus, I decided to provide the way to download it as chrome extension here: 
### Step 1 : 
Download the .zip file - [Yoimanga.zip](https://github.com/hikki78/Yoimanga/files/11824568/Yoimanga.zip)

### Step 2 : 
extract the .zip file and Go to  
###### any chromuim browser://extensions/

### Step 3 :
Toggle the dev tool on and use load unpack to load your Yoimanga file onto the extension section.

### Step 4 : 
Enjoy!!!!
